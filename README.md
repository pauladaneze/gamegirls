#metoo voices is an interactive sound installation representing the Twitter #metoo movement. Using Twitter’s API, the installation counts how many times the hashtag #metoo has been tweeted or retweeted. When a participant says “Me too!” into the megaphone, the installation counts the number of instances of the hashtag in the last minute and plays recordings of people saying “Me too!” in that number.
